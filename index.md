# Coding Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Alexander Kotzeff and I am a third year student pursuing a double major in Neuroscience and Computer Science with a certificate in Neurotechnology. In this portfolio, I hope to demonstrate some of my coding knowledge through projects I worked on in class and in my free time.
