My name is Alexander Kotzeff and I am a third year student pursuing a double major in Neuroscience and Computer Science with a certificate in Neurotechnology. In this portfolio, I hope to demonstrate some of my coding knowledge through projects I worked on in class or in my free time.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AlexKotzeff/AlexKotzeff.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
